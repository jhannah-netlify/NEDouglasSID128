The SID wastewater treatment facility has two motor blower sets that are critical to the plant functioning.  The remaining original motor failed when OPPD buried the power line to the facility this fall so one of the two motor/blower sets is out of commission.
<!-- excerpt -->
I’d like to get the failed motor replaced before winter sets in because the second motor failing would be an emergency and could lead to additional damage if temperatures are below freezing in addition to potential permit violation(s).  

I recommend that we replace the failed motor with a Baldor EM3311T.  This is the motor  model that replaced the other original motor and it has been in service for a few years now (5-ish?).  The cost of the new motor is $1,230.20 and a conversion mounting plate is another $70.  It has a three year warranty.  I’d also propose to have nearby electricians that have worked at the plant before do the wiring as I’m not that confident with 3 phase wiring.

The Board voted to approve this request.
