In an attempt to bring our wastewater plant into compliance with our permit, I think the SID needs to dispose of a significant portion of the biomass that’s in the aeration basin.
<!-- excerpt -->
It’s years and years of biomass and it’s hampering the aeration basin’s ability to stir/aerate effectively.  I have discussed this in our last few SID meetings and I’d be happy to answer questions.  

My plan is to slowly pump the aeration basin down to the sludge / biomass layer and then have pump trucks pump out the biomass.  It will be the same pump trucks that service the facility typically, except that I hope they will be able to pump out significantly more biomass with the basin mostly emptied of water.  I would like to be able to pump out up to four trucks (4 x $425 = $1,700) depending on how well pumping appears to be working.  Please let me know if you are good with me proceeding with this plan.

Approved by a vote of the Board.
