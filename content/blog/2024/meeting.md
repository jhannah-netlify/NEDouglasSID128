The budget meeting of your SID has been scheduled for September 18, 2024, at 6:00 p.m. at St. Johnâ€™s Lutheran Church.  As soon as I receive a copy of the Financial Report and a copy of the Budget, I will email it to you.  Also, I will be sending the Notice of Meeting to you about a week in advance of the meeting.
