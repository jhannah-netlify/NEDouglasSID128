I’m providing the SID notification that the sludge scraper system in the rectangular clarifier malfunctioned yesterday due to the worn gear/sprocket described in my email below and that the wear on the main scraper drive chains is significant enough (imminent failure) that to repair the system, the sprocket, chains, skids, and wear plates would need to be replaced, which is significantly more work than is quoted in the $14k quote recently received by the SID.  The proper function of the clarifier is critical to effectively treating the SID’s wastewater.

(WWTF).

Today, I asked Embris if they can have their draft report submitted to the SID before the 18 September budget meeting.  The scope of the report includes options to replace this antiquated chain driven system.  I hope that we can discuss the repair and replacement options at the budget meeting, but TBD if that will be possible pending report completion.

Picture of the sister chain on the other side of the axle.  Note that the chain has almost failed (falling apart at the pin).  I highly suspect this chain will break if the system is turned on and allowed to run through a cycle.  Both chains are very worn and should be replaced if the sprocket is replaced.

## Board Discussion

Thanks for the updates. I have a few questions to help me understand timing and seriousness.

Are we going to make it to the 9/18 meeting before severe breakdown?

* Severe breakdown occurred on 8/29.  The rectangular clarifier will not operate as intended until repairs are completed, which means the WWTF is not operating as designed.

If this thing breaks down, is it going to be weeks to replace?

* If we decided to repair it, I'd guess we are a minimum 2-3 months from repairs being complete.  I am guessing probably a similar timeline to replace, but more uncertainty on the replacement time given I don't yet know what the solution would be.

How long can we go with an inoperable system before we have major violations?

* I plan to take our quarterly samples on Monday (tomorrow).  I am guessing the ammonia will exceed our permit limits, which has been typical over the last few years.  Given the less stringent winter effluent requirements, I'd estimate we have until next May to have a fully functioning clarifier before our effluent testing would result in significant violations.

I don't want to spend a lot of good money on an old system but also want to avoid major catastrophe.

* Agreed!  I'm guessing we are in the $40k - $50k range to repair the current system and that will not be replacing a lot of the critical components.  I think we have enough time to evaluate the alternatives and make the best long-term decision for the neighborhood.  I'm hoping we can also evaluate if there are different treatment alternatives that would allow the SID WWTF to consistently meet the effluent permit limits and reduce future operation and maintenance costs.  It would be ideal if the SID had WWTF that was sized for our neighborhood of 30 houses instead of maintaining a 60 year old WWTF that is sized for 300 - 500 houses.

Thanks for all this information.  We should discuss at the 9/18 meeting to the extent possible, but this is important enough that it is worth scheduling a separate meeting a short time after the budget meeting to discuss and develop a plan.
