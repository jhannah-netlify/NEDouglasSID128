The Budget meeting for SID 128 was held on September 17, 2025 at 6:30 p.m. at St. John’s Church.

The Minutes of the meeting are available as a 128 page PDF from any Board Member,
or the SID Lawyer.

Very short summary:
* Proposed 2024-2025 Budget discussed and approved by the Board.
* Property tax request unchanged from previous year. $76,369.40 (0.80635%).

Our options regarding the WWTF, and Embris Group recommendations, were discussed by the Board, below.

## Embris Group tech memo DRAFT

The Embris Group tech memo draft, dated July 18 2025, is available as an 82 page PDF
from any Board Member, or the SID Lawyer.

Very short summary of our options (pages 16, 17 of PDF):

### Do Nothing

The facility is at or near the end of its lifespan and is having difficulty staying in
compliance with its NPDES discharge permit. Permit limitations should be taken
very seriously. Notice of violations can be escalated into fines or consent
orders.

It is recommended that the SID consider improvements to the facility.

### Bare Minimum: $150K

The facility is facing critical repairs that are needed immediately. This
includes repairs to the clarifier mechanism to bring it back online. These
repairs are considered the bare minimum for the continued operation of the
facility. Temporary measures could include the use of a long reach scraper on a
handle to move settled material in the clarifier to the air lift, but keeping
the air lift operational to return activated sludge to the aeration basin is
critical to the operation of the facility. The other alternatives presented in
this section will likely have a 2-5 year implementation horizon and thus needed
repairs should still occur.

Other primary maintenance items that should be strongly considered include
replacement of all electrical equipment and full rebuilding of the aeration
headers. The electrical equipment at a minimum should be brought up to current
code with new panels and switch gear. Operational effectiveness could be
improved with minor upgrades to improve control over blower runs and air lift
runs to have better control over the aeration tank.

This alternative could have a wide range of expected costs, but for budgeting
purposes, it is proposed to budget a minimum of $150,000.

### Connection to the City of Omaha: $3M

The nearest public sanitary gravity sewer is approximately 10,800 feet or
approximately 2 miles away. A connection to this sanitary sewer would need to
occur through the installation of a long forcemain that is fed either by one
central lift station for the neighborhood or through a series of smaller lift
stations located at each household. Embris is currently under design for a
similar sized lift station with an approximately ¼ mile length of forcemain
that is estimated to cost just over $1 million. The additional length of
forcemain needed for SID 128 would expect to raise that estimate by another
$1.4 million.

With soft costs and contingencies, it should be budgeted that this would be an
approximately $3.0 million dollar project. It is noted that beyond the 31 homes
located in SID 128, the forcemain would pass directly in front of another
approximately 50 properties and more properties if side streets are considered.
These properties exist within a large unsewered area that could be considered
for a larger sanitary improvement. The use of shared forcemain by smaller lift
stations located at individual lots, is a feasible, albeit less common way of
conveying wastewater as a pressure system. These types of systems are largely
used in terrains that are not adept to gravity sewers such as flat low-lying
areas or in areas with large changes in terrain. The pump systems usually use a
positive displacement style so that multiple pumps operating do not impact the
head conditions of one another. This alternative could be considered through
consultation with the county or the City of Omaha as part of a larger
improvement.

### Full Replacement: $1-2M

This alternative would consider the full replacement of the facility with
another mechanical treatment plant. This alternative is constrained by the
available room available at the existing site. Although a new facility would be
significantly smaller in size, to locate it will require heavy construction in
a limited area. A replacement for the size of facility needed would fall into a
packaged style of treatment of which there would be numerous options. The
building could be re-utilized to house blowers and electrical equipment. The
budget for this type of improvement should be in the $1.0 - $2.0 million range.

### Rehabilitation and Optimization: $750K

A rehabilitation and optimization of the existing tankage could look at
re-utilizing the tankage in a different way. Aero-Mod is a leading manufacturer
of wastewater treatment equipment located out of Manhattan, KS. Aero-Mod has a
drop-in clarifier called their ClarAtor. This equipment would be fixed within
the existing aeration basin, thus reducing the overall volume of that tank.
Additional measures could be looked at to even reduce it further. The ClarAtor
utilizes weirs on the side of the tankage to allow the aeration basin to
overflow into the new clarifier and utilizes a hydraulic suction hood connected
with air lifts to move solids collected in the clarifier.

This would have the added benefit of freeing up the existing clarifier basin to
be a sludge holding tank thus increasing the operational flexibility of the
facility. The ClarAtor would include new diffusers for the aeration basin, thus
eliminating the need for those improvements. The electrical replacement
improvements would still need to be pursued. A budgetary estimate for this
level of improvement is $750,000.
