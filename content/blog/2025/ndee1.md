SID Board - FYI, The Nebraska Department of Water, Energy, and Environment
(NDEE) is required to inspect the SID 128 WWTF at least once per NPDES permit
cycle (5 years).  Yesterday, an Environmental Specialist from the NDEE
inspected the SID 128 wastewater treatment facility from approximately 11-noon.
The inspection form he provided at the conclusion of the inspection is
attached.  He commented that the "The operator is actively working on repairs &
maintaining operations at the facility." and "The operator struggles w/ ammonia
requirements & is requesting assistance from engineering section." We agreed to
engage the State of Nebraska DEE engineering group to come for a site visit and
review of the plant/perform some testing to determine if they can recommend any
process improvements to address the regular ammonia effluent exceedances.  It
appears this follow-on visit will occur on Thursday, 30 October.

(WWTF).

Note that in the inspection form, he checked the box "Further agency discussion
needed to determine compliance." He stated that the NDEE will likely issue a
letter of Non-compliance to the SID due to the regular ammonia effluent
exceedances.  He also noted that continued exceedances may result in
enforcement / fines by the EPA, which could force the SID to invest heavily in
the wastewater treatment facility to meet the currently permitted effluent
limits. (Please let me know if/when you receive this letter so that I
can formulate a response.)

I mentioned my preference that the NDEE relax the ammonia effluent limits for
the next NPDES permit starting 1 Apr 2027.  He listened and was completely
non-committal but didn't dismiss it as impossible (which I think was the best I
could hope for).  He reminded me that the NPDES discharge permit renewal
application is due at least 6 months prior to the current permit expiration or
NLT 30 Sep 2026 for SID 128.  I plan to assemble the renewal application for
submission starting in June 2026.
