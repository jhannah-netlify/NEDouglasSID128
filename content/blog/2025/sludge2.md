I applied to Community Engineering Corps for some pro-bono engineering consulting services for the SID wastewater plant.  Unfortunately, CECorps did not approve the application because SID 128 did not meet their "underserved" criteria.  
<!-- excerpt -->

An engineering consulting company visited the SID WWTF about a month ago.  I anticipate receiving a proposal from them for engineering services to scope modernization of the sludge scraper system.  I'll pass that along for the board's consideration when received.  Given the wear-and-tear on the existing sludge scraper chain system, I anticipate that some money will need to be invested in repair or replacement this year.
