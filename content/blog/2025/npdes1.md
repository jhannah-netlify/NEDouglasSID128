SID Board - I'm seeking SID Board approval to purchase an
[optical dissolved oxygen meter](https://www.usabluebook.com/ysi-prosolo-odo-dissolved-oxygen-meter-and-probe-k-77154)
for approximately $2,000 with shipping.  Purchase of this dissolved oxygen
meter will be a key part of the "plan to address the ammonia exceedances" that
is required per the Letter of Noncompliance that the SID received from the
NDWEE on 11/7/2025.  Please respond with your approval, disapproval, or
questions.  Note that this appears to me to be the least costly way to
adequately respond to the NDWEE Letter of Noncompliance.

[ The Board voted to approve the purchase. ]

Background and Update:

**30 Oct 2025:** 2 Engineers from the NDWEE visited the SID 128 WWTF.
They inspected the facility and used a variety of instrumentation
to measure the facility performance with a focus on improvements that would
allow the facility to meet the ammonia effluent requirements.  The report from
the NDWEE is attached.  In summary, they think better dissolved oxygen
management may improve the plant performance, but they recommend replacing the
facility with a complete retention wastewater lagoon, a large community septic
system and lateral field, or individual septic systems at each dwelling.  I
followed up with the NDWEE about what the process would be should the SID
choose to replace the WWTF (email attached).  One item of note, the NDWEE has
zero and low interest loans for wastewater infrastructure projects that the SID
could be eligible for.

**31 Oct 2025:** Building Crafts Inc. (BCI) and Grunwald Mechanical both visited
the WWTF at different times to inspect the chain driven sludge moving system
for the clarifier so that they can prepare bids for repair of the system.  Both
companies envision procuring materials over winter and performing the repairs
in early spring.  I have not received either bid, but I anticipate repair costs
to be $50k-$100k+.  Needed repairs are the replacement of a stainless steel
drive shaft, bearings, two sprockets, both drive chains, skids, and wear
plates.  I anticipate that the SID will need to undertake these repairs as the
functionality of this system is essential to meet effluent limits.

**7 Nov 2025:** As a follow-up to the
[21 October 2025 NDWEE inspection](../ndee1) of the SID
WWTF, the NDWEE sent a Letter of Noncompliance (attached) which requires
additional documentation and a plan to address ammonia exceedances be submitted
by 15 December.  I can craft a decent response to this letter, if we purchase
an optical dissolved oxygen meter as requested above.  During the 30 Oct 2025
NDWEE engineer visit, it became apparent to me that the $100 dissolved oxygen
meter that I have is not accurately measuring dissolved oxygen and that a more
accurate and reliable dissolved oxygen meter is needed if I am to attempt to
run the system at a dissolved oxygen level low enough that denitrification may
occur, which could reduce ammonia levels.

**By 5 Dec 2025:** Embris plans to submit the final report on the WWTF to the SID.
In this report, Embris plans to add the following options for facility
replacement (as recommended by the NDWEE): a complete retention wastewater
lagoon, a large community septic system and lateral field, or individual septic
systems at each dwelling.  I think one of these solutions is likely a more
cost-effective wastewater solution for the SID, but more to follow on that.
