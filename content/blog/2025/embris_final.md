Attached is the final report from Embris on the wastewater treatment facility.

*[ The 104 page report is available to any home owner by contacting any member of the Board or the SID Lawyer. ]*

Alternatives of individual septic systems, a combined septic system, and a
lagoon were considered.  The land area needed for a complete retention lagoon
is prohibitive.  A smaller lagoon would likely have similar effluent compliance
issues as the current WWTF.  The report states that additional research would
be needed for individual septic systems though it's not promising/unlikely.
The report states that the combined septic system would be complicated and
would require additional land, but I have followed up with a question on this
one as I think it may be possible to site a combined septic system on the south
and south east portions of the existing WWTF property.

The question is whether the SID would want to invest additionally in
assessing/designing a replacement option for the existing WWTF.  If anything, I
would think the SID would hire an engineering firm to validate feasibility and
design a combined septic system on the existing WWTF facility property.  The
benefit of doing so is that it would likely be a more cost effective solution
for the SID long-term and would remove the effluent reporting/compliance issue
the SID currently has.  Below is info on the state survey regarding low
interest loans from the state, which could be an option to pay for design
services.  Responses are due by 15 January for 2027 needs.  The other option
for the SID is likely to continue to not comply with the effluent permit
requirements (I continue to try different approaches, but the facility is
massively oversized) and see what happens with the NPDES permit renewal in
March 2027.  The NDWEE may require the SID to address the issue by investing
additional money in the WWTF or, less likely, the permit requirements may be relaxed
given its a facility that only serves 30 houses.  Any thoughts on path forward?

"Also on this page is a tab for
[“Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund”](https://dee.nebraska.gov/forms/publications-grants-forms/wat190),
which would likely be of interest to the SID. This program offers low interest
loans to communities with the possibility of grant assistance or loan
forgiveness. The first step would be to fill out the 2027 SRF Needs Survey with
an estimated cost of the wastewater needs of the SID. They can only offer
assistance to communities that are in the 2026 Intended Use Plan (IUP), and
getting in the IUP requires submitting that Needs Survey document. The Survey
is due on January 15th of this year, and there is no cost to submit other than
the possibility of hiring an engineer (you may be able to fill out the form on
your own if you’re a PE, I’m not sure. This would be a question for the SRF
section. I’ve never encountered a wastewater facility where the designated
operator was a PE before)."
