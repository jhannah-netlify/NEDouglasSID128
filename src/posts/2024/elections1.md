The Douglas County Election Commission has sent a letter to the Board Clerk and our Lawyer about
this year's elections. If anyone wants to be on the Board of Directors of the SID, the deadline
to file to get you on the ballot is Friday July 19. The election is September 10.
<!-- excerpt -->
All property owners will receive their ballots via USPS in plenty of time to mail them back in
before September 10.
