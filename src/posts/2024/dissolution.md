Our WWTF is our largest ongoing expense, and the primary reason the SID hasn't
been dissolved, or annexed by Omaha, for decades now. The Board was interested
in exploring all options of long-term strategies.

I was finally able to have a discussion with in our office regarding the possibility and feasibility of dissolving SID 128.
 
The bottom line is that theoretically it would be possible but he does not see a practical way to actually accomplish it.  Essentially you would need to get 100% of the residences onto septic systems, remove the sewer plant, make sure those tasks are completely paid off, and then the SID could be dissolved.  He does not believe this would be practical.  Another option would be to privatize operation of the sewer plant and then dissolve the SID, but this also does not appear practical.  Some type of operating entity would need to be created, would send bills to residents, and would need to pursue legal collection actions against residents who don’t pay.
 
The current structure is the “least worst” option because people have no choice about paying their property tax bills, and because the sewer plant is funded by the taxes, residents are able to receive a tax deduction for the payments.  Payments to install and maintain a septic system or privately operate the sewer plant would not be tax deductible.
