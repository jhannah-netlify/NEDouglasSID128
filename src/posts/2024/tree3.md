I am seeking Board Member approval to have two additional trees removed for $1,900 that were damaged in this year's wind storms when they return to the SID Wastewater Treatment Facility (WWTF) to finish the remaining ground clean up of the tree removals that they completed this year.
<!-- excerpt -->

I think the proposed cost of removal of the two additional trees $1,900 is reasonable given that the trees are both difficult to access and are over the six foot security fence and one of the two is over the aeration basin (large pool of sewage) which will require roping and lowering pieces of the tree.  I requested a quote these two trees specifically given their damaged state and the significant likelihood that they will damage plant equipment when they fall. They also quoted two additional trees for $2,400 that they ranked as 2nd priority for removal as you may note in the attached quote.  I am not seeking approval for this 2nd priority work at this time because these trees are in a bit better condition and they appear likely to only cause fence damage if they fall.

They are returning to the site to finish clean up because when OPPD trenched the WWTF powerline, they left a significant swath of soft bare earth (mud) that would have been destroyed by the cleanup equipment, so it was mutually determined best to delay the impacted clean up to this winter (though they completed 90% of the cleanup which was accessible).

The pictures in the attached proposal show the trees in question, but I am happy to show any of you the specific trees at the WWTF upon request.

I think the tree removals and trimming that occurred earlier this year likely saved the SID from costly damage to the power infrastructure and the equipment at the WWTF.

In other news, I recently determined that Chuck was supplementing the biological process at the WWTF with nutrient and bacterial supplements.  I am hopeful that the effluent ammonia levels may comply with the SID NPDES permit with the use of these supplements once the weather warms up again next Spring.  More to follow on that.

The Board voted to approve this request.
