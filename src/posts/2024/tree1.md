Tree removal is scheduled for 25 & 26 March.  OPPD came to scope dropping the
powerline and determined they want to trench bury the powerline that is
currently laying on the ground between the transformer and power pole.  OPPD
pulled this new line as an emergency repair during a winter storm 3 or 4 years
ago when a tree fell and broke the power line. This has been a safety and
reliability of power concern.

OPPD has asked that the SID clear the small trees and tree debris on the route
between the transformer and power pole.  It's a relatively small amount of
work, it makes a lot of sense to complete this work on the one day that the
powerline is de energized from a safety perspective.
