First the good: OPPD buried the powerline to the wastewater plant (at no cost
to the SID), which is an improvement in safety and power reliability.

And the bad: The original 3-phase 7.5hp aeration system motor (1960's vintage)
failed.  I suspect OPPD cycling power to it could have been the last leg, but
this motor was overdue for failure / replacement, and I have been looking for a
cheap backup (to no avail) since I started helping Chuck at the plant.  The
aeration system has two parallel motors and PD blowers.  The other motor was
replaced in early 2019 for $1,978.64.  Replacing the failed motor is a priority
(the parallel setup allows for maintenance time and redundancy in case of
failures) and I'll start to gather quotes for presentation to the Board.
