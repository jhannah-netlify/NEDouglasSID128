I contacted 6 fencing companies and received quotes from two: Cardinal and American Fence Company.  There are a lot of companies that install residential fencing, but less that repair commercial fencing.
<!-- excerpt -->

The scope of repairs that American Fence quoted is a bit more comprehensive, but I think either of the proposed repairs will satisfy the NDEE (State of Nebraska) as far as addressing the deficiency that was noted in the last permitting inspection.  Interesting to note that Cardinal's bid was a couple hundred dollars less than the bid they submitted a couple years ago, which I would guess is attributable to the tree clearing and site cleanup (better access to the fence).

If the Board approves, I'd like to give Cardinal the go ahead on the repairs.  Thoughts?  Input?
