I am gathering three quotes for tree trimming and removal at the wastewater plant.  I'll package and email the quotes soon after receipt for Board review and hopefully approval.

In an effort to get the wastewater treatment facility fence repaired (as required in the last NDEE inspection and that which the SID conveyed intent to repair Spring 2022), I have started the process of gathering 3 quotes for cleanup and removal of trees.  The trees that I am looking at for removal and trimming are those that directly conflict with or have significant dead portions that threaten the fence (the fence needs repaired due to multiple tree strikes) and those that threaten the WWTF overhead power line, the facility, and the onsite mechanical systems.  I've tried diligently to limit the removal of large trees due to the $$'s associated.  To ensure consistency of the work being quoted, I have marked the 12 trees to be removed and the 4 trees to be trimmed.

Winter is the best time to complete this work.  The large manlifts and other machinery necessary to remove trees over the security fencing will do minimal damage to the grounds while the ground is frozen.  Also the work is cheaper both because there are no leaves (less material) and because the tree removal companies have less work and consequently bid it lower.

OPPD has asked that the SID clear the small trees and tree debris on the route between the transformer and power pole.  It's a relatively small amount of work, it makes a lot of sense to complete this work on the one day that the powerline is de energized from a safety perspective.

**December 21:**

As soon as the trees are removed and trimmed, I intend to get quotes for repair of the perimeter fence.  

Background: As part of the NPDES Permit renewal process (the permit which allows the SID to operate the wastewater treatment facility), on **17 Dec 2021** the SID received a Letter of Noncompliance.  The letter required the perimeter fence to be repaired by **1 Feb 2022** (pg 1&2 of 26) and lists comment #3 (pg 7 of 26):

> Housekeeping of the facility should increase.  With perimeter fence repair and debris removal around comminutor being most obvious.  Over hanging trees should be cut back to prevent future damage...

The Return to Compliance Letter states:

> The board of trustees is noted to be considering fence repair proposals... Continued compliance is contingent \[on\] following the conditions set forth by your permit, specifically preventing exceedances before they occur and the repair of the fence as soon as the weather allows.
