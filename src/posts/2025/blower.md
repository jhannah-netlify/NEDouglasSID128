Update: Install Complete: The new motor installation was completed on 12/26/2024 with new wiring from the control panel to the motor, wired, and tested the motor.  In preparation, I had removed the original motor, installed the frame conversion kit and new motor, installed the belt sheave on the drive shaft and aligned it, and properly tensioned the belts.

Total cost was $1,817.01: $1,385.86 for the motor which came from P&H in Fremont, $100 for a preparatory site visit, and $331.15 for the install.  The site visit was almost an hour with one electrician, and wiring and testing took almost two hours with two electricians.  As a comparison, the SID paid $1,978.64 in early 2019 to replace the North PD blower motor with the same motor model.
