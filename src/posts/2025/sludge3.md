SID Board Members: I'm seeking your approval for the attached quote for $5,000 for engineering services in support of the wastewater treatment facility (WWTF).
<!-- excerpt -->

<a href="/about/#wastewater-treatment-facility-(wwtf)">About our Wastewater Treatment Facility</a>
(WWTF).

The intent is that these engineering services answer two questions:

1) Is it time to repair the chain driven sludge scraper system est. $25 - $30k, which is the cost to replace on sprocket and the chains, or will it be more cost effective to replace this system with a more cost-effective modern solution, and
2) If the SID was to replace the WWTF, what treatment solution would be appropriate for our scale (30 households vs. the 500 households that our WWTF is designed for), minimize costs, and meet permit requirements.  This second portion of the scope is only high level and an additional quote, funding, etc would be needed to develop the solution to a level that could be bid.

## Scope of Services – Study and Report Phase

Technical Memorandum:
1. Conduct additional on-site observations of the system as necessary.
2. Collect additional background data including the following:
   * As-built plans
   * DMR records from the State
   * Other correspondence or information on past improvements
   * Data related to the number of customers and service area for the treatment system

3. Prepare and submit an evaluation in the form of a technical memorandum (TM) based on observations and understandings. The TM should address the following at a minimum:
   * Existing and projected wastewater flows
   * Background information and sizing of the existing treatment facility based on as-built plans
   * Summary of site investigation and observations
   * Options or recommendations for the repair of the rectangular clarifier and a high-level budgetary opinion of cost.
   * Risk assessment tool evaluating other alternatives for the treatment of the SID’s wastewater. The risk assessment should evaluate capital costs, annual operating costs, operational capability, and compliance with regulations for the following options at a minimum. The risk assessment will be based on general knowledge of improvements and will provide high-level budgetary opinions to
express capital expenses.
      * Do Nothing
      * Rehabilitation of the Existing System
      * Replacement of the Existing System
      * Conveying the Wastewater to Another System
   * Recommendations for the SID to consider

The Board voted to approve hourly consulting to that engineering firm, in a total amount not to
exceed $5,000.
